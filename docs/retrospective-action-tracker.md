## Tips for Action Item Success

1. **Be Specific:** "Improve testing" → "Add integration tests for payment flow"
2. **Assign One Owner:** Shared ownership often means no ownership
3. **Set Realistic Dates:** Better to under-promise and over-deliver
4. **Track Progress:** Weekly updates keep items moving
5. **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge completed improvements in retros
6. **Review Regularly:** Items that sit for >30 days should be re-evaluated
7. **Limit WIP:** 3-5 active items per team; more creates dilution
