# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management process documentation. These guides centralize our team's knowledge about how we run cross-functional projects, from initial concept through release and continuous improvement. By documenting our processes, we reduce single-person dependency risk and ensure that every team member can find clear guidance on roles, workflows, and best practices. Whether you're new to OctoAcme or looking for a refresher on specific processes, this documentation serves as your central reference.

OctoAcme follows a structured project lifecycle designed for iterative, customer-focused delivery. Projects move through five key phases: **Initiation** (defining the problem statement, stakeholders, and high-level timeline), **Planning** (breaking work into actionable increments with clear acceptance criteria), **Execution** (building and testing in regular sprints with continuous tracking), **Release** (deploying to production with verification and rollback plans), and **Retrospective** (capturing learnings and driving continuous improvement). This lifecycle ensures that every project has clear ownership, measurable outcomes, and regular checkpoints to adjust course based on evidence and feedback.

Our process is built around clearly defined **roles and personas**. The **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and cross-team communication. The **Product Manager (PdM)** defines customer outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success against business metrics. **Developers** implement features collaboratively with attention to quality and testability. **QA/Testing** validates that acceptance criteria are met before release. **Stakeholders** provide inputs and approvals throughout the lifecycle. This role clarity enables teams to work efficiently while maintaining accountability and psychological safety.

**Communication and quality assurance** are embedded throughout our process. Teams follow a regular cadence of daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates, with ad-hoc escalations as needed. We maintain transparency through shared project boards, risk registers, and status updates. Quality is ensured through unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end smoke tests, security scanning in CI, and manual QA for feature acceptance. Before every release, teams complete a comprehensive deployment checklist that includes pre-release requirements, rollback plans, smoke tests, and post-deployment verification. After each sprint or release, retrospectives convert learnings into actionable improvements, tracked and reviewed in weekly syncs to foster a culture of continuous improvement.
